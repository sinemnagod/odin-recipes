# odin-recipes
This is my first project ever! I will create a website of recipes, first with HTML then CSS and then JavaScript.
I hope I learn how to make a good website.

I first created an index page containing the title of the page and an unordered list of recipe links.
Then I created 3 different webpages for cinnamon rolls, pasta salad, and pizza recipes.
For each recipe I added the title, a descriptive image, a short description, the ingredients, and lastly the directions.
